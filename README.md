## Requirements

### Run the App on iOS or Android

#### Requirements
Install Flutter & Dart for your OS by following [this guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).  
As IDE, you could use Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ or Android Studio. Optional you can download the Flutter plugin/extension in each IDE
#### How to run
1. Open the folder with your IDE
2. Then run `flutter pub get` (may take a while) in the console
   * This downloads all required dependencies
3. Connect your Android or iOS device and make sure its unlocked
4. Execute `flutter run`
   * If you have multiple devices, you can run the app on all of those, by executing `flutter run -d all`
   * Optionally you can also add the `--release` parameter, which prevents flutter from starting the debug mode. The app will be published in this mode
5. Test the app on your device after it has built
